# Back in Time Trivia

I created this app using the [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The idea behind the app is to practice retrieving data from an external API and render it to a browser.






## Functionality

![alt tag](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExYWxhZzhqN2c3Y215Y3R4bXBsdnU0ZmlpaTJjNWZjMGNrOGxoZnE0NyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/t2qfy4FENpCFXhSPj8/giphy.gif)

- The app displays a single question with a set of answer options to choose from.

- Users have the option to make their selection and promptly receive feedback on their choice with a message at the bottom.

- Each time the user answers correctly, they win a point which is displayed at the top of the quiz.

- Each time the screen is refreshed or user clicks on the 'next question' button, a new randomly generated history question appears.


## Planning & build process

After examining the API docs, I tested API calls using ThunderClient. After ensuring everything worked as expected, I planned out the functionality of the app using computational thinking to break down the logic into smaller pieces of code.
## Optimizations

At the moment all the questions in the quiz are related to my favourite subject of history. In future, I would like to 
- Allow users to select the quiz question category
- choose number of questions

## Reflections
I had alot of fun selecting illustrations for this app that reflect the theme of the project :) It also helped in deepening my understanding of fetch, async/await syntax and DOM manipulation. Looking forward to build this project in React!
