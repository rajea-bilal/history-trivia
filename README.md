# Back in Time Trivia

I created this app using the [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The idea behind the app is to practice retrieving data from an external API and render it to a browser.






## Functionality

![alt tag](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExYWxhZzhqN2c3Y215Y3R4bXBsdnU0ZmlpaTJjNWZjMGNrOGxoZnE0NyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/t2qfy4FENpCFXhSPj8/giphy.gif)

- The app displays a single question with a set of answer options to choose from.

- Users can make their selection and will promptly receive feedback on their choice with a message.

- Each time a user answers correctly, they earn a point which is displayed at the top of the quiz.

- Whenever browser is refreshed or user clicks on the 'next question' button, a new randomly generated history question appears.


## Planning & build process

I reviewed the documentation and tested API calls with ThunderClient. Using computational thinking, I planned out the app's logic and broke down the project into smaller code components. 
## Optimizations

At the moment all the questions in the quiz are related to my favourite subject of history. In future, I would like to 
- Allow users to select the quiz question category
- choose number of questions

## Reflections
I had alot of fun selecting illustrations for this app that reflect the theme of the project :) It also helped in deepening my understanding of fetch, async/await syntax and DOM manipulation. Looking forward to build this project in React! 

## Tech Stack
